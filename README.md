Rent Price Prediction for House Using Machine Learning
The "Rent Price Prediction for House using Machine Learning" project is aimed at developing a robust and accurate system to predict the rental prices of houses based on various features and attributes.
The project utilizes the Random Forest Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle complex regression tasks with high-dimensional data.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate house rental prices with a high level of accuracy. 
By harnessing the power of machine learning and employing the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, we seek to provide valuable insights to both landlords and tenants. 
Landlords can use the predictions to set competitive rental prices for their properties, while tenants can gain a better understanding of fair market values.
In addition to the predictive model, we have developed a user-friendly web application using Flask. The web application allows users to input the features of a house and, with a click of a button, obtain an estimated rental price. The integration of the Random Forest Regressor model into the web application enables seamless and convenient access to the rent prediction functionality. The web application provides an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to interact with the predictive model without needing to have a background in data science or machine learning.
